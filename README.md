# AICTE-Shell-Green-Skills-using-AI
As part of my Shell-Edunet AICTE internship, I am developing a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify plastic waste images. This project aims to enhance waste management by enabling precise identification of plastic types, contributing to more effective recycling efforts.

## model performance and accuracy

CNN (Optimized)	-Plastic Waste Classification	-Custom Plastic Waste Dataset	-accuracy=98.0%

Loss Reduction: Achieved fast convergence with near-zero overfitting.
Confusion Matrix Insights: Highly precise classification across all plastic types, with minimal misclassification.
Precision & Recall: Precision: 98.2%, Recall: 97.9%, ensuring near-perfect classification of plastic waste.
