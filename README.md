# AICTE-Shell-Green-Skills-using-AI
As part of my Shell-Edunet AICTE internship, I am developing a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify plastic waste images. This project aims to enhance waste management by enabling precise identification of plastic types, contributing to more effective recycling efforts.
